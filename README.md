## Background
Solving a real world problem in Mental Healthcare using MVC framework (Handlebars, Node.js, Javascript, Materialize CSS, mySql, map). In today's world, mental health is a topic that is very relevant.  Even NBA stars like Kevin Love have come out and shared their struggles about with mental health. Doing a quick google search for a mental health professional gives you a generic list of Psychologists, Psychiatrist and other mental health professionals.
