# Healthy Heads
(Rohit Maharjan, Tom Dennis, Morgan Bradley, Irene Rojas)

##Background
Solving a real world problem in Mental Healthcare using MVC framework (Handlebars, Node.js, Javascript, Materialize CSS). In today's world, mental health is a topic that is very relevant.  Even NBA stars like Kevin Love have come out and shared their struggles about with mental health. Doing a quick google search for a mental health professional gives you a generic list of Psychologists, Psychiatrist and other mental health professionals.  But what if you want a specific professional to help you with your specific problem such as BPD or your OCD?  This is a much harder search.  Healthy Heads project looks to solve this problem.

The main functionalities of this project includes:
-user authentication (using Passport) with error handling 
-An awesome search feaature that can filter by age, years in practice, gender, specialty, language and insurance accepted of the professional

The project incorporates a login feature, and the ability to sign up. Once inside, a user can search for professionals by city, state, specialty, insurance, language, gender, and years in practice. Even before searching, a user can see all the professionals. Profiles include a photo (from randomuser.me), address, and the aforementioned search parameters. The search site also features a map.

We used Sequelize, Handlebars, Passport.js, Leaflet, SQL, Materialize, and CSS to create and style the pages. The basis for the logo came from: https://image.freepik.com/free-icon/brain-inside-human-head_318-46850.jpg.
